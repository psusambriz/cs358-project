# cs358-project

ðŸ”§ Project Overview

Youâ€™re constructing a custom interpreter in Python from scratch. This interpreter will:
	1.	Represent code using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
	2.	Evaluate the AST to produce results (no parsing yet)
	3.	Eventually parse code (but thatâ€™s for Milestone 2)

 ðŸ§  Milestone 1 Goals (Now)

You need to implement:
	â€¢	A basic expression language, including:
	â€¢	Integer arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
	â€¢	Boolean logic (and, or, not)
	â€¢	Comparison (==, <)
	â€¢	Variables and let bindings
	â€¢	if conditionals
	â€¢	A domain-specific extension (DSL), with:
	â€¢	A new value type (e.g., strings, images, music, etc.)
	â€¢	At least 2 literals of this type
	â€¢	At least 2 custom operators that act on those literals
